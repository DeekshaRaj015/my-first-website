                <h2>Meet Beck - Owner & Founder of Little Glow Candle Co</h2>
                <p>When she’s not hand-pouring candles, Beck’s enjoying the simple things— like sipping a caramel iced latte, getting stuck into a good romance book, watching the footy or F1, strolling through the markets, relaxing with a face mask, or spending time at the beach with family and friends.</p>
                <p><strong>Beck's current favourite scent:</strong> Guava & Lychee and Stress Less</p>

            <p>Little Glow Candle Co began as Beck’s hobby—something small, made with love. After her first market, when strangers connected with her candles, she realised it wasn’t just about scent—it was about creating calm in everyday lives.
             Through challenges and self-doubt, Beck stayed focused on helping others slow down and feel cared for. Today, Little Glow is more than a candle brand—it’s a reminder that self-care is simple, powerful, and something we all deserve.</p>
