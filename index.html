            <h3>Danielle</h3>
            <p>“10/10 would recommend for your bedroom, study or living room. The stress less scent is so relaxing, calming and just smells divine. I honestly think it has helped me get to sleep quicker each night but also just fills up the room and lasts for months!! I think it’s almost been a year since I bought mine and it’s only just at its end (even after turning the reed sticks once a fortnight). The best value for money!"</p>

            <h3>Kailtlyn</h3>
            <p>"I have so many of these candles and I will never stop buying them. They smell amazing ( black raspberry and vanilla especially) and they burn for so long. No bad smell when you blow them out, they are strong enough to fill my house with a gorgeous long lasting smell even when they aren’t burning. Highly recommend you purchase some they are 100% worth every dollar you spend"</p>

            <h3>Kylie</h3>
            <p>"I am completely obsessed with these diffusers. I love the Black Raspberry and Vanilla fragrance. Everyone always comments how nice my house. The fragrance is long lasting but not sickly or overpowering. I have a dog so didn’t want anything too strong. I’m also very sensitive to smells. These are one of the few diffusers that don’t give me a headache. I also love that I’m supporting a small SA business."</p>
