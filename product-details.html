    <h2>Our Glow Stories</h2>
    <p>The Signature Range was born in a quiet kitchen, late at night, when the world finally slowed down. What started as a simple way to unwind after long shifts became a passion project—mixing fragrances, melting wax, and pouring by hand, all while dreaming of something more. Every candle in this range reflects that journey: from hobby to hustle, from burnout to balance. Made with love, care, and a belief that everyone deserves a little glow in their day, this range is for those who do it all—and still find time to light something just for themselves.</p>
